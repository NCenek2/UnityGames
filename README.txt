GAMEPLAY
There are 4 levels. 

Level 1 is in the top right corner. The objective is to dodge the zombies for a 
minute, then a door will appear for completion of the level. 

Level 2 is in the bottom left corner. You must use double jumping to get to the door.
The key here is to take advantage of double jumping off of the side of ground components.
Timing is also key.

Level 3 is in the top left corner. The objective is to kill all the zombies with
snowballs.

Level 4 is in the bottom right corner. The objective is to kill the big ghost, which
spawns smaller ghosts. As the boss's health decreases, its color will get more red, 
it will increase in speed, and it will spawn ghosts more often. Beware of the snowball
recharge.
